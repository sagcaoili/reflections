When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    There are several situations where you would want to do this including - working on a computer other than your own and needing to commit files to access later or when you're working collaboratively.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Depending on the type of project your working on, you may not want to have the files constantly pused ot GitHub
