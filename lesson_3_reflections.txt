When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    There are several situations where you would want to do this including - working on a computer other than your own and needing to commit files to access later or when you're working collaboratively.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Depending on the type of project your working on, you may not want to have the files constantly pused ot GitHub

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

		Forks- clone someone else's repositories from GitHub and creates a copy on your GitHub without affecting the orginal repository
		Clones - You can clone a repository off of your own computer or copy a GitHub repository from the internet to your own computer
		Branches - Creating a branch affects the orginal files, Like when you're working on a collaborative project and have many people working on updates - branches allow you to track those changes on one repository. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	Being able to work offline

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Without using Git or GitHub, you could share files using a cloud service automatically. But keeping track of changes from others, or tracking prevous versions we be harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	If you're working with others, creating a seperate branch allows you to make creative or inivatives changes that you might not ordinarily make. In addition, it allows the group you're working with a chance to preview your code before merging it into the master.
