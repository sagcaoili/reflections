When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    There are several situations where you would want to do this including - working on a computer other than your own and needing to commit files to access later or when you're working collaboratively.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Depending on the type of project your working on, you may not want to have the files constantly pused ot GitHub

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

		Forks- clone someone else's repositories from GitHub and creates a copy on your GitHub without affecting the orginal repository
		Clones - You can clone a repository off of your own computer or copy a GitHub repository from the internet to your own computer
		Branches - Creating a branch affects the orginal files, Like when you're working on a collaborative project and have many people working on updates - branches allow you to track those changes on one repository.
